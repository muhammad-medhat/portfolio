My journey started in 2007 with ASP.Net\r\n        and C#, later transitioning to PHP and open-source technologies in 2010.\r\n        Since 2020, I’ve focused exclusively on WordPress development, crafting\r\n        custom themes, plugins, and WooCommerce solutions tailored to\r\n        businesses' needs. I’ve worked on diverse projects, from e-commerce\r\n        platforms to corporate websites, ensuring performance, scalability, and\r\n        seamless user experiences. Some of my notable projects include custom\r\n        WooCommerce templates, WordPress plugins, and developing engaging\r\n        content-driven sites.\r\n        <blockquote className=\"blockquote mt-3\">\r\n          Beyond development, I’m passionate about coaching and mentoring\r\n          aspiring freelancers, helping them build careers in web development\r\n          through hands-on guidance. I’ve collaborated with organizations like\r\n          Elhareefa and DEBI to support students in navigating the freelancing\r\n          world. If you’re looking for a skilled WordPress developer to bring\r\n          your project to life—or need guidance on launching your freelancing\r\n          career—I’d love\r\n        </blockquote>\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p className=\"no-border blockquote\">\r\n        Thank you for taking the time to read my about me page.
