      <h2>Welcome to the world of VSCode extensions!</h2>
      <p>
        As a passionate developer, I have explored a plethora of extensions that
        have elevated my coding experience with Visual Studio Code (VSCode). I
        am thrilled to share some of my favorite extensions with you here.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>IntelliSense Boosters </h3> Supercharge your coding productivity
          with extensions like IntelliSense for JavaScript, Python, or PHP.
          These extensions enhance the built-in IntelliSense capabilities of
          VSCode, providing intelligent code suggestions, auto-completion, and
          documentation, making coding faster and more accurate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3> Git Integration</h3>Streamline your version control workflow with
          extensions such as GitLens or Git History. These extensions bring
          powerful Git functionalities directly into VSCode, allowing you to
          view blame annotations, navigate commit histories, and visualize code
          changes seamlessly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Code Formatting</h3>Maintain consistent code styling effortlessly
          with extensions like Prettier or ESLint. These tools automatically
          format your code according to predefined rules, ensuring clean and
          professional-looking code without manual effort.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Debugging Assistance</h3>Simplify the debugging process with
          extensions like Debugger for Chrome or Python. These extensions
          provide a seamless debugging experience within VSCode, allowing you to
          set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code with
          ease.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Productivity Boosters</h3>Enhance your productivity with
          extensions such as Live Share or Todo Tree. Live Share enables
          real-time collaboration, allowing you to code together with teammates
          remotely. Todo Tree helps you manage and track TODO comments and tasks
          in your codebase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Language Support</h3>Expand your language capabilities with
          extensions like Visual Studio IntelliCode or Go. These extensions
          provide language-specific enhancements, including intelligent code
          completion, syntax highlighting, and code snippets for various
          programming languages.
